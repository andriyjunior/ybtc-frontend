    "data": "<span> Hospital beds, surgical clamps, portable high-powered lights, antibiotics, even iodine. <br /> <br /> These are just a few of the items that will fill the charter flight leaving Whitehorse, Yukon, Canada, to make their way across the North Atlantic to hospitals in Ternopil and Yuzhnoukrains’k, Ukraine. <br /> <br /> On a recent trip into Eastern Europe, one of our Yukoners managed to make contact with health care workers, doctors, and hospital directors in Yuzhnoukrains’k and Ternopil, Ukraine. <br /> <br /> Yes, some humanitarian aid is flowing to Ukraine and refugees across Eastern Europe. <strong> But issues remain with the distribution of those goods, and the quality of the supplies when they arrive. </strong> Not to mention that as a result of Russian aggression, an estimated 10 million Ukrainians are now displaced. International estimates put the casualty rate as high as 500 a day, and that number just continues to rise. <br /> <br /> Health care workers in Ukraine are in dire need of antibiotics and other supplies that help save not only extremities but the lives of Ukrainian defenders and innocent civilians. Workers continue to struggle with improperly stored or expired medications. Shipments may go missing or are difficult to transport where they most needed. To top it off, COVID-19 is still very much a reality in Ukraine, with vaccination rates estimated at only 38%. <br /> <br /> <strong>To this end, we are starting a special partnership. We’d like you to join #YukonToUkraine.</strong> <br /> <br /> #YukonToUkraine is a special partnership between the Yukon Building Trades Council, the Yukon Government, the Yukon Hospital Corporation, and you, to deliver a 737 aircraft full of supplies directly to the hospitals, doctors, and nurses who need urgently need them. <br /> <br /> The Yukon Government and Yukon Hospital Corporation will be contributing large items such as portable hospital beds that would otherwise be sold as surplus. The Yukon Building Trades is raising money to purchase necessary antibiotics that will be sourced and stored by Yukon Hospitals in order to have the maximum positive impact in Ukraine. <br /> <br /> These items will have to be purchased, stored, and transported across the Atlantic. First, from Whitehorse to Warszawa, Poland. <strong> From there, our team of Ukrainian logistics workers will transport the goods 500 km away to Ternopil, then another 600 km into Yuzhnoukrains’k, meaning a total of 1,067 km from Warszawa into central Ukraine, just north of Odessa. </strong> <br /> <br /> This is no small feat. <br /> <br /> <strong> The Yukon Government will be making a further financial contribution to match the funds raised by the Yukon Building Trades Council. </strong> We ask that you support this effort – supplies will go directly to where they are needed most urgently, and you can be sure they will arrive. If you do not require a tax receipt, cheques can be made out to the “Yukon Building Trades Council.” If you do require a tax receipt, make cheques out to the “Yukon Hospital Corporation.” <br /> <br /> The memo line should read: “Yukon to Ukraine,” or see the attached fillable form. <br /> <br /> Thank you in advance for your support of Ukraine. If you’d like to learn more, or want us to present to your organization, please contact us at any time. <br /> <br /> In solidarity for Ukraine, <br /> <br /> Jeff Sloychuk, President <br /> Yukon Building Trades Council <br /> #407 – 6100 – 6 th Avenue <br /> Whitehorse, YT | Y1A 1M5 <br /> 780.266.8719 | president@yukontrades.ca <br /> </span>"
